# FluxoMetrics

This repository contains the Fluxometrics Fiji script to extract single-cell fluorescent time-series data from image stacks and an R script to normalise the data, extract parameters (min, max, decay and recovery rate...), plot the results and perform statistical analysis. Template files for the 96-well multiplate layout and metadata are included as well.
Please refer to the individual scripts for their usage. Good luck!

The code accompanies Steenberghen et al., 2024, first published on 06 November 2024 https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.24905. Please cite our publication as well as the packages it relies on to make it work
if you use this code. Thank you.
