# FluxoMetrics

This repository contains the Fluxometrics Fiji script to extract single-cell fluorescent time-series data from image stacks and an R script to normalise the data, extract parameters (min, max, decay and recovery rate...), plot the results and perform statistical analysis. Template files for the 96-well multiplate layout and metadata are included as well.
Please refer to the individual scripts for their usage. Good luck!

The code accompanies Steenberghen et al., 2024. Please cite our publication if you use this code, as well as the packages it relies on to make it work.
